# Animated-Satellite-Images
Homework 4 for CSC 308 at EKU. A simple iOS app to display animated satellite images.

To run: download repository and either open in xcode or put on a compatible iOS device.

At the top of the screen, there is the option of "Visible" and "Infrared". This switches between what image type will be displayed.

Below the display of the images/animation is a label that will reflect the current speed the animation will play at.

The "-|+" stepper controls how quickly the animation will play. Maximum speed is 14 frames every 1 second, and minimum speed is 14 frames every 5 seconds.

To begin the animation, press the "Play" button. To stop the animation, click the same button which should now be labeled "Stop".

*Note* Has only been tested on an iPhone 11 emulator. May not work as intended on other emulated devices/real hardware.
